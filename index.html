  <p>A wave of femicides has grabbed the headlines of the Cuban non-state press in recent times. Although the government has hidden figures and denied the situation, the truth is that several independent organizations have confirmed and registered 62 femicides in all of 2023, 26 more than those registered the previous two years and an alarming number when compared to Spain, a country with a population four times larger that last year reported 49 femicides.
</p>

<p>Despite the complaints, the Cuban government ignores the claims of activists that could improve the situation. To date, there is no Comprehensive Law Against Gender Violence in the country, nor a disappearance alert, nor prevention programs in schools, nor a Penal Code that typifies femicide as a crime and not as just another death caused by gender-based violence. There are no shelters either, and the government's women's helpline barely works.
</p>

<p>How can a Cuban woman save her life if she is in a situation of violence? Cuban psychologist Lilian Rosa Burgos offered some advice, in the absence of a support program from the Cuban state.

  <p>According to Burgos, in the first place a woman must recognize that she is a victim of male violence, if any type of mistreatment, control, domination, detect dysfunctional behavior. "You don't have to wait for physical violence, marks on the body, attempted femicide or extreme violence to know that you are at risk," she warned.

  <p>Then a woman at risk should seek help and get away from the aggressor. The specialist recognizes that although there are no safe institutions in Cuba such as shelters, the woman should seek other safe and effective networks such as friends or family. She should also break the silence. "It is necessary to speak honestly about the real danger that exists, which is not a matter of gambling, but of survival," she said

<p>There are also independent organizations and groups that offer accompaniment and legal help to Cuban women in situations of risk such as Cubalex, Me Too Cuba, ACI, AfroAtenas, Caritas Cuba or the Ministry of Women to Women in Cuba.
